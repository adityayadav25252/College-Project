üöÄ Project Title & Tagline
================================

**Project Title:** React Campus Map
**Tagline:** A React-based campus map application for easy navigation and exploration

üìñ Description
================

The React Campus Map is a web application designed to provide an intuitive and interactive way to navigate and explore a university campus. The application uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite, a modern web development tool, to create a fast and efficient development environment. The application also utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to style the application's UI components.

The React Campus Map allows users to view a map of the campus, search for specific buildings, and view information about each building. The application also includes features such as a side panel that displays additional information about the selected building, and a cancel button to easily dismiss the side panel.

‚ú® Features

1. **Interactive Campus Map:** The application displays a map of the campus, allowing users to browse and zoom in/out of the map.
2. **Building Search:** Users can search for specific buildings by name or location, and the application will highlight the building on the map.
3. **Building Information:** Each building on the map has a corresponding information panel that displays details about the building, such as its location, name, and description.
4. **Side Panel:** A side panel displays additional information about the selected building, including its location, name, and description.
5. **Cancel Button:** A cancel button allows users to easily dismiss the side panel and return to the map view.
6. **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
7. **Fast Development Environment:** The application uses Vite to create a fast and efficient development environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and development.
8. **Utility-First CSS Framework:** The application uses Tailwind CSS to style the UI components, allowing for easy customization and maintainability.
